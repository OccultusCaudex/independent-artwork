_The penguin, the laptop and the globe were made by "Ben Skwid Gailly"
Here are the tutorials on how to do it yourself !

I like to do things, but I like to teach...

_The globe was made by a circle, painted in blue, and the ground was made with the "Free Select Tool" on Gimp.

_The laptop was made with a rectangle for the front, two rectangles for the screen (one dark, one transparent), and the keyboard used the border's triangles in red to paint it in grey.

_The penguin was made with one circle+one oval shape for the body, on oval cutted in a "triangle" for the beak, four circles (two whites and two transparents) for the eyes, two oval grey shapes for the arms, one white circle cutted to fit the body for the belly and two circles cutted with the eraser tool to be the feet.
